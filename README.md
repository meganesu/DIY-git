# DIY Git

A project where I try to recreate Git commands from scratch.

Progress tracked at <https://trello.com/b/HsbXAc2T/diy-git>

# Installing

1. Clone this repo.
1. Open a console. From the root directory, run `npm run build` to compile all the JS using webpack.
1. From the root directory, run `npm start` to start up the Express server that hosts the app locally.
1. In a browser, go to `localhost:3000` to see the app running!
